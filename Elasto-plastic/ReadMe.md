# **Elasto-Plastic Hardening Models**  

This repository provides Python implementations of **elasto-plastic material models** with **isotropic** and **kinematic hardening**. It includes:  

- **`MaterialModel.py`**: Implements the two hardening models.  
- **`tutorials.py`**: Demonstrates how to use the models with five example problems.  
- **`test_hardening.py`**: Contains unit tests to validate the implementation.  

## **Installation & Dependencies**  

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed, along with the required dependencies:  

```sh
pip install numpy pytest
```  

## **Files & Usage**  

### **1. `MaterialModel.py`**  
This file contains two classes:  

- `IsotropicHardeningModel`: Implements elasto-plastic behavior with **isotropic hardening**.  
- `KinematicHardeningModel`: Implements elasto-plastic behavior with **kinematic hardening**.  

Both classes take material properties and compute stress-strain evolution.  

### **2. `tutorials.py`**  
This file provides **five example problems** using the implemented models.  

To run the tutorials:  

```sh
python tutorials.py
```  

Expected output:  
- Stress and plastic strain values for different loading conditions.  
- A comparison of isotropic vs. kinematic hardening.  

### **3. `test_hardening.py`**  
This file contains **unit tests** to verify model accuracy.  

To run the tests:  

```sh
pytest test_hardening.py
```  

If all tests pass, youâ€™ll see:  

```
All tests passed successfully!
```  

## **Example Usage**  

Example for running **Isotropic Hardening**:  

```python
from MaterialModel import IsotropicHardeningModel  

model = IsotropicHardeningModel(sig_0=0, ep_0=0, E=200000, H=10000, Y_0=250, n=50)  
sig, ep, Y = model.compute_stress(de=0.001)  

print("Final Stress:", sig[-1])  
print("Final Plastic Strain:", ep[-1])  
```  

Example for running **Kinematic Hardening**:  

```python
from MaterialModel import KinematicHardeningModel  

model = KinematicHardeningModel(sig_0=0, ep_0=0, E=200000, H=10000, Y_0=250, n=50)  
sig, ep, alpha = model.compute_stress(de=0.001)  

print("Final Stress:", sig[-1])  
print("Final Plastic Strain:", ep[-1])  
```
